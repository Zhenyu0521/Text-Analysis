 ## 1. Introduction of Text Analysis
 Text analysis, or [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) is the process of cleaning texts, digging out patterns behinds raw words, and combine texts with machine learning models. In this part, two projects related with text analysis are included. For the [SNP feedback analysis](https://github.com/Zhenyu0521/Text-Analysis/tree/master/SNP%20Feedback%20Analysis), I applied NLTK packages in Python to help SNP, one of educational companies, explore its customers' feedback of different courses and extracted some insights about its customers and markets. For the [Yelp reviews analysis](https://github.com/Zhenyu0521/Text-Analysis/tree/master/NLP%20for%20Yelp%20Reviews), I used math and statistics to get text in a format that the machine learning algorithms can understand and built up a machine learning model to predict restaurants' stars based on customers' reviews. What's more, I also applied AWS and GCP to conduct text analysis.
